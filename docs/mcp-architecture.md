## MCP Protocol Implementation Details

### Supported MCP Operations
1. **Text Completion**: Handle customer queries about products and services
2. **Tool Calling**: Execute business logic for deal generation and recommendations
3. **Resource Access**: Access product data and customer context

### MCP Endpoints
- `/mcp/chat`: Main endpoint for customer assistance conversations
  - POST: Accept customer queries and return assistance responses
  - Request body: CustomerQuery object
  - Response: AssistanceResponse object with recommendations and deals
- `/mcp/tools/deals`: Endpoint for generating personalized deals
  - POST: Generate deals based on customer context and product data
  - Request body: CustomerContext object
  - Response: List of Deal objects
- `/mcp/tools/recommendations`: Endpoint for product recommendations
  - POST: Generate product recommendations based on customer query
  - Request body: CustomerQuery object
  - Response: List of recommended Product objects
- `/mcp/resources/products`: Endpoint for accessing product data
  - GET: Retrieve all products
  - GET /{id}: Retrieve specific product by ID
  - Response: Product objects or list of Product objects
- `/mcp/resources/customer-context`: Endpoint for accessing customer context
  - POST: Store or update customer context
  - GET /{customerId}: Retrieve customer context by ID
  - Response: CustomerContext object

### MCP Protocol Message Format
The MCP endpoints will use JSON format for requests and responses, following the MCP protocol specifications:

```json
{
  "method": "method_name",
  "params": {
    "parameter1": "value1",
    "parameter2": "value2"
  }
}
```

Responses will follow the format:
```json
{
  "result": {
    "response_data": "data"
  }
}
```

Or for errors:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 500,
    "message": "Error description"
  }
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **Customer Query Processing**:
   - Customer submits query through frontend
   - MCP controller receives and parses the request
   - Query is processed by assistance service
   - Response is generated with recommendations and deals

2. **Deal Generation**:
   - Customer context and query are analyzed
   - Relevant products are retrieved from ProductContext
   - Business rules are applied to generate personalized deals
   - Response is formatted according to MCP protocol

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Assistance response is created with product recommendations
   - Personalized deals are included in the response
   - Response is formatted according to MCP protocol specifications

## Business Logic for Personalized Deals

### Deal Generation Algorithm
The deal generation process follows these steps:

1. **Customer Analysis**:
   - Analyze customer context (preferences, purchase history, location)
   - Identify customer segments (new customer, returning customer, high-value customer)
   - Determine customer interests based on query content

2. **Product Matching**:
   - Match customer interests with available products
   - Consider product categories and relationships
   - Apply product popularity and seasonal factors

3. **Discount Calculation**:
   - Base discount: 5% for all customers
   - Loyalty bonus: Additional 5% for returning customers
   - Volume discount: Additional 3% for bulk purchases
   - Seasonal promotion: Additional 2-10% based on current promotions
   - Special offers: Additional 5-15% for targeted campaigns

4. **Deal Personalization**:
   - Adjust discounts based on customer value
   - Apply time-limited offers for urgency
   - Include bundle deals for complementary products
   - Consider customer's price sensitivity

### Business Rules
- Maximum discount: 30% for standard customers
- Maximum discount: 50% for high-value customers
- Minimum order value for deals: â‚¬50
- Deal validity: 7 days from generation
- One deal per product per customer per week
- Special anniversary deals for long-term customers

### Recommendation Logic
- Product similarity based on name and category matching
- Trending products based on recent sales data
- Complementary products based on common purchase patterns
- New arrivals for customers interested in latest products

## Security Considerations
- CORS configuration for frontend communication
- Input validation for customer queries
- Rate limiting for MCP endpoints
- Error handling and logging

## Deployment Considerations
- Integration with existing ASP.NET application
- Shared configuration settings
- Monitoring and logging integration
- Performance considerations for real-time assistance

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with external AI services for advanced natural language processing
- Machine learning models for better deal personalization
